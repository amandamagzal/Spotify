This repository is for a project in a data visualization university course.

In this project, we created different visualizations (using JavaScript D3) to explore the relationship between popularity, genre and emotions expressed in songs.

The dataset we used contains all the songs in Spotify's Daily Top 200 chart in 35+1 (global) countries around the world for over 3 years (2017-2020). It can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top50spotify2019

### The pages:

* Visualization #1 - when you select a genre from the index, the radar chart presents the average score of each emotion for the chosen genre, and the barplot presents its average popularity score.

* Visualization #2 - when you select a country on the map, the boxplot presents the distribution of each emotion for the chosen country. The color of the country corresponds to the most popular genre.

* Visualization #3 - when you select an emotion from the combo box, a word cloud is created with the top 15 songs for the selected emotion. The color of the song corresponds to the genre. The bigger the titile, the higher it's ranked. Click on title to be redirected to Spotify and listen to the song!
